# NPPTextFX2
TextFX2 is a Notepad++ plugin which performs a variety of common conversions on selected text.

The original project has been dead since 2008. Now Notepad++ has started to block the plugin without any notice and arbitrarily with version 8.4.3, so that it is no longer loaded.

So I grabbed the source code with the aim to bypass the blocking. But in the process I made some cosmetic changes that bothered me.

- Complete removal of HTML Tidy
- Removal of no longer needed or working menus

The plugin is now loaded again by Notepad++ and should you disable that again even with the new name, then I will adjust the plugin again.

Original source code for version 0.25 (dated 2008) can be fround from https://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/TextFX/. That code can be made to build on modern Visual Studio and it supports Unicode, but 64-bit build is impossible.
